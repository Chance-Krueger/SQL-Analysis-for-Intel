To maximize energy savings and CO₂ reductions, Intel should prioritize repurposing mid-range devices (4–6 years old), as they deliver the greatest environmental benefits per unit. While newer devices are repurposed in higher volumes, focusing more on mid-range hardware will enhance overall energy efficiency and carbon savings. Additionally, Intel should tailor its repurposing efforts by region, concentrating on areas with higher carbon intensity in electricity generation (such as Asia) to achieve greater CO₂ emissions reductions. This targeted strategy will ensure resources are used most effectively, balancing device age and geographic impact to drive the largest possible sustainability gains.
