Intel repurposes significantly more newer devices (under 5 years old), which are more energy-efficient but yield lower average energy savings per device compared to mid-range devices.


Mid-range devices (4–6 years old) offer the highest average energy savings and CO₂ reductions, representing a strategic opportunity for maximizing environmental impact.


Older devices (7+ years) have the lowest energy savings and CO₂ benefits, suggesting limited returns on investment for repurposing very old hardware.


Targeting repurposing efforts in regions with higher carbon-intensive electricity (e.g., Asia) can amplify CO₂ emissions reductions, making location an important factor in strategy optimization.
