ChatGPT’s suggestions helped me better understand the importance of focusing on mid-range devices rather than just newer ones, highlighting their higher energy savings and CO₂ reductions per device. It also emphasized the regional impact of electricity carbon intensity, which I hadn’t fully considered before. This insight improved my recommendation by adding a geographic dimension to the strategy, making it more targeted and data-driven. Overall, ChatGPT helped me create a more nuanced and effective plan for Intel’s repurposing program.
